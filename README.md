## Quick Setup (Windows & macOS)

1) Install Python 3.11+ and MariaDB.
   - macOS: `brew install mariadb && brew services start mariadb`
   - Windows: install MariaDB and ensure the "MariaDB" service is running.

2) Create DB + user (once, via MariaDB console):
   macOS: `sudo mariadb`
   Windows: `mariadb -u root -p`
   Then run:
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS conduit_game;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'gameuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON conduit_game.* TO 'gameuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;


3) Clone repo & install Python deps:

git clone https://github.com/Finleyboyy/Conduit-game-.git
cd Conduit-game-
cp .env.example .env # Windows: copy .env.example .env


4) Load airports (no server flags needed):
python src/load_airports.py





Conduit Game

A text-based horror survival game where the player must travel between airports to find and close mysterious conduits hidden across the world.

üéÆ Gameplay Overview

The player always starts at HEL Airport (Helsinki, Finland).

At the beginning of each run, 10 random airports are selected from the global database.

5 of these airports secretly contain conduits that the player must discover and close.

Travel costs Markka (in-game currency), and distance between airports affects the price.

Players can access their Inventory at any time to:

View the ‚ÄúBloody Note‚Äù (which lists the 10 airports in play).

Check Markka balance, sanity, and other items (weapons, potions, etc. ‚Äî being developed).

Press [I] for Inventory, [H] for Help, or [Q] to quit the game.

üóÑÔ∏è Tech Details

Written in Python 3.13.

Uses MariaDB to store airport and run data.

Future expansions include combat and sanity systems handled by other team members.

üöÄ Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Finleyboyy/Conduit-game-.git


Install requirements:

pip install mariadb geopy


Load the airports CSV into MariaDB (see src/load_airports.py).

Run the game:

python src/game_db.py

üìå Notes

This is a collaborative project, different members are handling different systems (combat, doom clock, inventory expansion, etc).

The database ensures every playthrough is fresh and randomized.
